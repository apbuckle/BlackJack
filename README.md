# BlackJack


For the first project, wanted to create a BlackJack game.  Will follow same rules of Amerian style BlackJack.  When player enters game they will play against the house/dealer.  Objective is to score high card total without going over 21 than the dealer's hand. You will have the option to hit (asking for an additional card) or stand (keeping your cards and not taking any more cards).  Player wins if the house bust(goes over 21) or have a higher total than house wihtout busting.  Dealer must hit on a total of  16 or less and will stand on 17.  BlackJack is when you receive 21 on the deal out.

Future features

- Additional playing options with spliting cards, douubling bets and insurance if dealer starts with an Ace.
